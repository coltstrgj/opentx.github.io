While reviewing some reported avr radio bugs, we have discovered a major issue affecting OpenTX 2.2.x on the following radios : 9x, 9xr, 9x128, 9xr128, gruvin9x and mega2560.

Installing 2.2.x on those radio will result in a corrupted Eeprom. The radio will look fine at first, but any use with Companion will wipe the radio and model settings.

We have therefore **disabled the download of 2.2.x firmwares for those radios**.

AVR radio users are advised to stay on 2.0 or 2.1 branch, for both Companion and firmware, as no new development for avr has been made since the last 2.0 versions
